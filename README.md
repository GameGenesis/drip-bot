üîÆ Next Steps

We see Drip Bot as more than a hackathon project, and we plan to keep building on it:

- **Integrate Shopping APIs**: Connect to APIs from retailers (e.g., Uniqlo, H&M, Shopify) to fetch real product data with images, prices, and direct links for recommendations.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Improve the UI with more interactive visuals, shareable result cards, and smoother onboarding.
- **Bridge Businesses & Customers**: Allow brands to showcase their products directly within Drip Bot, creating a channel that helps users discover clothing while giving businesses a way to reach style-conscious audiences.
- **Refine AI Analysis**: Experiment with multimodal, vision-capable models for more accurate outfit analysis.
- **Personalization**: Add user profiles, saved outfits, and context-aware recommendations based on wardrobe history or event types.

Our goal is to move from a prototype into a tool that helps people make confident style choices while also giving businesses a way to connect with their customers in meaningful, AI-powered ways.
